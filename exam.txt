There'll be 5 questions in the exam.

-Know the proofs for Tverberg and Helly, and know the few applications (e.g. those in the exercise sheets).

-Know convexity.

-Polytopes:
Know the definitins, basic properties etc.
Be familiar with C(n,d) and its (d-1)-dimensional faces. Be familiar with the Gale condition (and proof).

-UBT for polytopes:
Know the steps for the proof of UBT.
Know the h-vector and h-vector. Know their relations (explicitly and H_X(t) = F_X(t-1)).

-Homology:
A bit of homology, considering we don't know the standard computations of homology.
E.g. look at exercises 1-5.

-Shellability:
Know R(F_i), X = \bigcup_i [R(F_i), F_i], etc.
